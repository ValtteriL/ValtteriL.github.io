      <description>GoIP-1 GSM gateway could be harnessed for phone fraud by hackers While listening to Risky Business ep. 642, I learned about a botnet that has been abusing a vulnerability in TP-Link routers to provide SMS messaging as a service for years. The exploited vulnerability allowed the botnet operator to send SMS messages on someone else&amp;rsquo;s bill and the operator sold this capability for others, including other criminals. Similar services are no doubt used when you receive smishing messages notifying you about false packages stuck in customs.</description>

      <description>I made 56874 calls to explore the telephone network. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found.  What kind of systems are there in the Finnish telephone network today?
 This question appeared to me a while ago when leafing through an old telephone directory from the early 2000s.
There are at least ordinary subscribers, business customer support lines, voice mails, and fax machines. Subscribers and customer support lines are not of special interest to me.</description>

      <description>What I learned of the VOIP hacker scene by setting up a SIP Honeypot I got interested in telephones and the Voice Over IP (VOIP) scene soon after reading Phil Lapsley&amp;rsquo;s Exploding the phone (2013). According to the book, there is a whole underground of VOIP hackers. I had not come across them while lurking in the information security scene. After my interest sparked, I started paying more attention to telephone-related security research.</description>
