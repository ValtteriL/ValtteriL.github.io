### Me

Hi! My name is Valtteri. I'm a hacker.

I love to apply knowledge across domains and spend much of my limited freetime trying novel things on a computer.
Some of those experiments end up here as writeups.

Beyond my love for computers and security, I enjoy books, board games, trekking, and fishing.

I work as a Senior Security Engineer at [Konecranes](https://www.konecranes.com/).
Previously, I worked as a [freelancer](https://molemmat.fi) and developed an [OPC UA security scanner](https://opalopc.com).

Feel free to reach out with any questions or just to say hi at [valtteri@shufflingbytes.com](mailto:valtteri@shufflingbytes.com)
