### Me

Hi! My name is Valtteri. I'm a hacker and a father of 2.

I love to apply knowledge across domains and spend much of my limited freetime trying novel things on a computer. Some of those experiments end up here as writeups.

I'm currently employed as a Senior Security Engineer at [Konecranes](https://www.konecranes.com/). Formerly I have done [freelancing](https://molemmat.fi) and developed an [OPC UA security scanner](https://opalopc.com).

### This blog

In this blog I publish my research and curiosities around (computer) security.

### Contact

If you have any questions or just want to say hi, you can reach me at [valtteri@shufflingbytes.com](mailto:valtteri@shufflingbytes.com)
